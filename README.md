# Hi, I’m Nat 👋

**Senior Product Designer** specialized in **SaaS B2B and enterprise UX**.  
I focus on **design systems, UX strategy, and data-informed design**, and I love bridging design and front-end development (React, Tailwind, Git).

- 🌍 Remote-first; worked with teams across the U.S., Europe, and LatAm  
- 🧩 Design → Dev handoff that engineers actually like  
- 🧪 Research, analytics, and A/B testing to guide decisions  
- 🧭 Currently open to full-time remote roles
